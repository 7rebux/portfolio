Today is the 8th day of this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Slowly puzzles will become a lot harder,
which means that I will mainly focus on explaining my solutions rather than explaining the surrounding story.
Of course, you can still read about every day's story on the official [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website
(You do not even have to solve the challenges for that).

So with that said let's get straight into today's puzzle!

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8)

Let me explain today's problem with the example input:

```text
RL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
```

In the first line we have a list of instructions which are either `L` (left) or `R` (right).
The rest of the input consists of a network. Every line has a root node and 2 destination routes (either left or right).
The format looks like this: `root = (left, right)`.

Our goal for the first part is to start at node `AAA` and count all the steps until we reach node `ZZZ`.

Let's start by parsing the input.

## Parsing

I will create a function for that which returns a list of the direction sequence and also a map which represents the network.

```kotlin
private fun parseInput(input: List<String>): Pair<List<Direction>, Map<String, Pair<String, String>>> {...}
```

To parse the directions we can simply take the first element of the input list and map all the characters to either left or right.
I also created an enum class for that for better representation:

```kotlin
private enum class Direction { LEFT, RIGHT }
```

The parsing then looks like this:

```kotlin
val directions = input.first().map { if (it == 'L') Direction.LEFT else Direction.RIGHT }
```

To parse the network we drop the first two lines of the input and then map it to an entry of our map which takes the root node
as its key and the left and right node as a pair.

```kotlin
val entries = input.drop(2).map { line ->
    val instruction = line.split(" = ")
    val (left, right) = instruction
        .last()
        .split("(", ")", ", ")
        .filter(String::isNotBlank)

    return@map instruction.first() to Pair(left, right)
}.toMap()
```

Now we just `return Pair(directions, entries)` and we can move on to actually solving the first part.

## ⭐ Part 1

Let's begin by creating two mutable variables. One for our current position (which is `AAA` in the beginning)
and one to keep track of our step count.

```kotlin
var current = "AAA"
var steps = 0
```

Now I create a while loop which runs until our current position is our destination (which is `ZZZ`).
Inside this loop all we have left to do is to calculate the next position and increase `steps` by `1`.

```kotlin
while (current != "ZZZ") {
    val next = entries[current]!!
    val dir = directions[steps % directions.size]

    current = if (dir == Direction.LEFT) next.first else next.second
    steps++
}
```

Also, what I forgot to mention is that we can not run out of directions because we just repeat that sequence over and over.
This can simply be done by just taking the remainder of the size of all directions as the index.

This actually already is everything for part one.

Let's quickly write up a test for all the example inputs:

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Long> = mapOf(
    listOf(
        "RL",
        "",
        "AAA = (BBB, CCC)",
        "BBB = (DDD, EEE)",
        "CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)",
        "DDD = (DDD, DDD)",
        "EEE = (EEE, EEE)",
        "GGG = (GGG, GGG)",
        "ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)",
    ) to 2,

    listOf(
        "LLR",
        "",
        "AAA = (BBB, BBB)",
        "BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)",
        "ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)",
    ) to 6
)
```

Both tests passed and also my output (`18827`) is correct.
First star ⭐ collected let's move on to the second part.

## ⭐ Part 2

There is a different example provided for part two. Let's take a look:

```text
LR

11A = (11B, XXX)
11B = (XXX, 11Z)
11Z = (11B, XXX)
22A = (22B, XXX)
22B = (22C, 22C)
22C = (22Z, 22Z)
22Z = (22B, 22B)
XXX = (XXX, XXX)
```

As we can see our input looks more or less the same. But actually there is no `AAA` and `ZZZ` node anymore.
For this part we are supposed to start at every node that ends with an `A` and count the steps until **all** the positions
simultaneously end on a node which ends with a `Z`.

Seems like things get a little more interesting here, but let's just start by writing the intuitive solution.

The first thing I'm going to do is to extract the logic of the first part into a separate function to reuse that here:

```kotlin
private fun countSteps(
    from: String,
    until: (String) -> Boolean,
    network: Pair<List<Direction>, Map<String, Pair<String, String>>>
): Int {
    val (directions, entries) = network
    var current = from
    var steps = 0

    while (!until(current)) {
        val next = entries[current]!!
        val dir = directions[steps % directions.size]

        current = if (dir == Direction.LEFT) next.first else next.second
        steps++
    }

    return steps
}
```

For the parameters I've got `from` which represents the starting position and also `until` which is a predicate which must
be truthy once the end is reached. We can not just use a string for `until` because there is more than just one possible
end in this part.

Now let's see how many starting positions we actually find in our input. For the example input these are just `2` (`11A` and `22A`).
For my input I have 6 starting positions.

Now everything should be super easy to implement right? Well it's actually not, let me explain.
The intuitive approach here would to just keep track of all the starting nodes and then use our while loop like in part one
until all of these nodes are a node which ends on `Z`. For the test input this works without a problem but for the real input
this will just not work ever. Because (spoiler) we have to take exactly `20220305520997` steps until we reach our goal.

It's fairly easy to count all the steps it takes for one starting position until it's end node. But not for all at the same time.
For solving this in a smarter way it's super important to know that once one node reaches its end it actually takes the same
amount of steps until it reaches a node which ends on `Z` again. By knowing this we can calculate the total steps for all start nodes.

This works by first determining how many steps it needs for all the nodes until itself reaches a node which ends on `Z`.
Then with all the numbers we can calculate the (least common multiple)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple], which
will be our solution.

Let me first show you how my final solution looks like and then explain the calculation process.

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Long {
    val network = parseInput(input)

    return network.second
        .filter { it.key.last() == 'A' }
        .map { entry -> countSteps(entry.key, { it.last() == 'Z' }, network) }
        .map(Int::toBigInteger)
        .reduce { acc, steps -> acc * steps / acc.gcd(steps) }
        .toLong()
}
```

As you can see I take all the keys of our network and filter for all the ones which end on `A`.
Then I map them to the amount it takes to reach the first end node.
And also I convert every single number to a `BigInteger` since they provide a `greatest common divisor` function
which we need to calculate our result.

To calculate the least common multiple of 2 numbers we can divide the product of them by their greatest common divisor.
So if we do this step by step for every number with have we end up with the least common multiple of all the numbers.
I achieve this by using the `reduce` function and then applying the formula for all the values.

With that everything for part two is finally done, and we got the second star ⭐ of today's challenge.

## Final Words

Today was a quite interesting day. It started with a pretty easy first part and then a complex second part which I'm actually not
sure what to think of. I like that you need to create a "smart" solution to solve it, but for that you need to know how the input works
which was not explained in the puzzle description. So I had to figure that out on my own.

You can view my full solution [here](https://github.com/7rebux/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/de/nosswald/aoc/days/Day08.kt).

See you tomorrow!
