Welcome back to today's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge!
I'm super excited to solve today's problem so let's get straight into it.

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10)

Today we find ourselves on a huge field of pipes. We made a sketch of the entire area and
this is going to be our puzzle input for today.

The example we are provided with looks like this:

```text
.....
.F-7.
.|.|.
.L-J.
.....
```

If you look closely you can see a loop in the middle of all those points. Points are just empty space and all the different
characters are a specific pipe. These are all the pipes we are supposed to handle so as you can see we got pipes for vertical
and horizontal connections and also corner pipes.

For simplicity reasons I replaced the upper left pipe with an `F`. In the example provided this is actually an `S`.
This marks the starting position of the pipe maze and this `S` pipe can represent any other pipe, but we don't know which.

Our goal for today is it to count the steps it takes to reach the farthest point in the maze, since this is a loop it would take
the same amount of steps in both directions. So my approach would be to find the entire loop and then just divide its length by two.

## ⭐ Part 1

Let's get started by looking for the starting point which is marked with `S` in the maze.

```kotlin
val start = Point(
    x = input.first { it.contains("S") }.indexOf("S"),
    y = input.indexOfFirst { it.contains("S") }
)
```

Once we have our start point we can use that as the origin to find the rest of the loop.
This is actually pretty easy because it's just a linear way, and we will find it if we either traverse the loop forwards
or backwards.

My implementation for this looks like the following:

```kotlin
val path = mutableSetOf(start)

while (true) {
    val (x, y) = path.last()
    val ch = input[y][x]

    // Up
    if (ch in "S|JL" && input[y - 1][x] in "|7F" && !path.contains(Point(x, y - 1))) {
        path.add(Point(x, y - 1))
    }
    // Down
    else if (ch in "S|7F" && input[y + 1][x] in "|JL" && !path.contains(Point(x, y + 1))) {
        path.add(Point(x, y + 1))
    }
    // Left
    else if (ch in "S-J7" && input[y][x - 1] in "-LF" && !path.contains(Point(x - 1, y))) {
        path.add(Point(x - 1, y))
    }
    // Right
    else if (ch in "S-LF" && input[y][x + 1] in "-J7" && !path.contains(Point(x + 1, y))) {
        path.add(Point(x + 1, y))
    }
    // Reached start point
    else return path
}
```

I use a set to keep track of all the points we already traversed in the loop. Once I find a valid connecting pipe
I just add it to the end of the set.
If we reach do not find any connecting pipe have not already visited we know that the loop is complete, and we just return the set of all
the points. Keep in mind that this gives us the points of the loop in a sorted order this is important for later.

Once that is done we can just return the length of the set divided by `2`and we should have the solution for the first part
of today's challenge:

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Int {
    return ceil(findLoopPoints(input).size / 2.0).toInt()
}
```

As you also can see I ceil the value of the equation because if the loop size is an odd number the farthest point is always the
next bigger number.

Running this gives me `4` for the example input and `6778` for my personal input.
Both values are correct, and we claim the first star ⭐ of today's challenge!

## ⭐ Part 2

Before I explain the second part let me show another example first, so you can better understand it:

```text
...........
.S-------7.
.|F-----7|.
.||.....||.
.||.....||.
.|L-7.F-J|.
.|..|.|..|.
.L--J.L--J.
...........
```

Take some time to understand the example because there is an inner and an outer loop, but they are still connected so both count.

The task for this part is to count all empty tiles which are located **inside** the loop.
For this example this would be the following tiles (I marked them with `x`):

```text
...........
.S-------7.
.|F-----7|.
.||.....||.
.||.....||.
.|L-7.F-J|.
.|xx|.|xx|.
.L--J.L--J.
...........
```

There are many different approaches on how to solve this, I went with checking for each point if the point is inside
the polygon (our loop).

Let me first show you the final `partTwo` function and then how I check whether a point is inside or not of the polygon.

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Int {
    val maze = input.flatMapIndexed { y: Int, line: String -> line.mapIndexed { x, _ -> Point(x, y) } }
    val loop = findLoopPoints(input).toList()

    return maze.filterNot(loop::contains).count { isPointInside(it, loop) }
}
```

So first of all I collected all points of the puzzle input with this neat oneliner. And then just like in part one I
searched for the loop points. With this information we can go through each point and filter out every point which is
already present in the polygon and then count all points which are inside the polygon.

Checking if a point is contained inside a polygon can be done by using a popular algorithm which works by creating rays from the point.
Fully explaining the algorithm here would make up for an own blog post, so I will try to explain it roughly and if you want
to learn more about it, you can read that in [this awesome article](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/check-if-a-point-lies-in-the-interior-of-a-polygon).

```kotlin
private fun isPointInside(point: Point, loop: List<Point>): Boolean {
    var inside = false
    var p1 = loop.first()

    for (i in 1..loop.size) {
        val p2 = loop[i % loop.size]

        if (point.y > min(p1.y, p2.y)) {
            if (point.y <= max(p1.y, p2.y)) {
                if (point.x <= max(p1.x, p2.x)) {
                    val intersection = (point.y - p1.y) * (p2.x - p1.x) / (p2.y - p1.y) + p1.x

                    if (p1.x == p2.x || point.x <= intersection) {
                        inside = !inside
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        p1 = p2
    }

    return inside
}
```

My function takes 2 parameters as its input: `point` the point to check and `loop` which corresponds to a set of all
points of the polygon in order.

Then I loop through each edge of the polygon and check if it is possible to determine an intersection of the point with the edge.
If there is an intersection I flip the `inside` value which initial value is `false`. This is basically the same as keeping track of an
intersection count and then checking if the number is odd or even.
In this case, if the number is `odd` the point is inside the polygon and if the number is `even` the point is outside.

There is obviously a lot of space for performance optimisations, but for these types of challenges I always try to aim for
an easy to implement fast solution.

I first tried to run the test with the input from above, and it indeed returned `4` points which are located inside the
polygon which is correct. And also the output for my puzzle input `433` is correct. There is the second star ⭐ of today's
challenge!

## Final Words

I really enjoyed today's problem because there are many ways to solve it and I also learned a lot while implementing my
solution. And especially part two was not really predictable from just seeing the first part.
Takes quite some time to fully understand the problem but once you do its super fun to solve it!
