  description='Solving the 5th day of Advent of Code 2023 in Kotlin'
  date='Dec 5, 2023'
/>

Yesterday in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) we helped an Elf to solve his scratchcards. In gratitude, he let us use his boat to reach the gardener.
The gardener tells us that they had to stop the water because they ran out of sand to filter it.
But he does not really have time to get more sand, because he is busy to make sure everyone on this island has enough food.

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5)

Today we have to help the gardener with his food production problem. For that he gave us the latest island almanac (our puzzle input).
It lists all the seeds that need to be planted and also its corresponding soil, fertilizer and so on.

Let's take a look at today's example input (I'm not going to paste the whole thing in here since it's kinda large):

```text
seeds: 79 14 55 13

seed-to-soil map:
50 98 2
52 50 48

humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4
```

In the first line are all seeds which need to be planted. In this example these are `79`, `14`, `55` and `13`.
The rest of the input contains of maps split by new lines. Each map has a name on it's first line and lots of numbers on every line after.
In every line there are exactly **three** numbers. These numbers are used to convert a source category in a destination category.
For example `seeds` as our source and `soil` as the destination (which is the first map in the input).

To better understand the conversion process let's take a look at the second line of numbers in the `seed-to-soil` map:

- `52` (Destination range start)
- `50` (Source range start)
- `48` (Range length)

As this is not direct map instead it uses ranges. We get the start of the source and the destination range and also the length for both.
That means with the 3 numbers we can build up 2 different ranges.

- Destination range: `52..100`
- Source Range: `50..98`

Keep in mind that the end value of both is actually not included.
To now actually map the first seed number `79` to its corresponding soil number we have to do the following:

- Which source range of the map contains the seed number? - `50..98`
- What is the number for the same index, as in the source range, in the destination range? - `81`

If there is no source range containing the seed number it just stays the same.

This process has to be repeated for all the seed numbers and also for each map until we reach final `location` number.
So after that every seed number is mapped to a `location` number.

The output for today must be the minimum of all `location` numbers.

Let's start of by parsing today's input.

## Parsing

I suppose the parsing process is going to be the same in part two so let's just create a function for that which returns
all the seeds and also the maps.

```kotlin
private fun parseInput(input: List<String>): Pair<List<Long>, List<ConversionMap>> {...}
```

And also some data classes simplify working with the values:

```kotlin
data class ConversionMap(val entries: List<RangeEntry>)

data class RangeEntry(val destinationStart: Long, val sourceStart: Long, val rangeLength: Long)
```

I don't store the name for the `ConversionMap` because its already sorted top to bottom in the input, and we can just pass it through.

With that done we can start by parsing the seeds. You may have also noticed that I'm using `Long` here instead of `Int`
since the numbers in my personal input are quite large.

```kotlin
val seeds = input
    .first()
    .removePrefix("seeds: ")
    .split(" ")
    .map(String::toLong)
```

For that we just take the first line, remove the `seeds:` prefix and map every number after that to an `Long`.

To parse the maps it's actually a bit more complicated. Since each map is split by two new lines I make a `String` out
of the input list, so we can split on `\n\n` since kotlin does not provide a function to split lists on a certain condition (sadly).
Also, we can just remove the first to lines since the first one is for the seeds and the second one is just empty.
The full parsing code for the maps then looks like this:

```kotlin
val maps = input
    .drop(2)
    .joinToString("\n")
    .split("\n\n")
    .map { block ->
        block
            .split("\n")
            .drop(1)
            .map { line ->
                line
                    .split(" ")
                    .map(String::toLong)
            }
            .map { RangeEntry(it[0], it[1], it[2]) }
    }.map { ConversionMap(it) }
```

I'm not going to explain everything in there since it's pretty much the same logic as for the seeds.
You can just read through it with the input next to it, and it should be self explaining.

Now with both of that parsed I just return `Pair(seeds, maps)` and the parsing function is done.

## ⭐ Part 1

With the parsing logic done, the first part is actually pretty straight forward.
Let me show you my code first:

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Long {
      val (seeds, maps) = parseInput(input)

      return maps.fold(seeds) { acc, map ->
          acc.map { source ->
              map.entries.find { source in it.sourceRange }?.destinationForSource(source) ?: source
          }
      }.min()
  }
```

Let's go through this line by line.
The first thing I'm doing is to fold on `maps` with `seeds` as the accumulator.
Then for every seed we try to find a `RangeEntry` in the current map which contains the seed.
If we find an entry we just call the `destinationForSource` function on it which I'll explain in a second.
And if we do not find an entry we just return source since it can stay the same.

So two things here which I didn't cover yet. First of all `sourceRange` is a property of `RangeEntry` which just
represents the range from `sourceStand` until `sourceStart + length`:

```kotlin
val sourceRange get(): LongRange {
    return sourceStart until sourceStart + length
}
```

And the second thing is the function `destinationForSource` which looks for the destination number of the given `seed` inside its ranges:

```kotlin
fun destinationForSource(source: Long) = destinationStart + (source - sourceStart)
```

At the end our fold function returns all the `location` numbers for the original seed numbers, and we can just take the minimum
value of that and return it.

Let's quickly test that with the test input:

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Long> = mapOf(
      exampleInput to 35
  )
```

Test passed, and also the output for my puzzle input is correct.
First star ⭐ of today's challenge collected let's see what's waiting for us at part two.

## ⭐ Part 2

So at part two things get a little different. We still have our maps and ranges and all of that, but we do not have normal seed numbers anymore.
Instead, we have huge entire ranges of seed numbers.
And we still have to find the lowest location number again at the end but this time for every single seed in the seed ranges.

This makes things a lot more complicated, since we can not just brute force every single seed number anymore.
I mean theoretically we could, but that would literally take forever. So we have to come up with a smarter way of doing this.

Let me first explain how these seed ranges are defined now since our input is still only giving us this list of numbers.

```kotlin
val (seeds, _) = parseInput(input)
val seedRanges = seeds.windowed(2, 2).map { start, length ->
    start until start + length
}
```

As you can see every pair of 2 seeds in the original input now becomes a range of seeds.
Starting at the first value and ending on the first value plus the second value (which is the length).

Now to find the overall lowest location for all the input seeds there are `2` possibilities that come to my mind.
The first one I think would be the more performant one, where we don't actually loop over every seed of all the ranges.
Instead, we would pass each seed down our `ConversionMap`s until we get ranges of output locations. And then we would
just return the minimum value of each location range.

But for now I'm going to write up my second idea, which will take much longer to run but which is way easier to write.
And since I do not have much time today, I prefer this solution for now. But I might do a follow-up post to this day
later.

So let me explain my idea. Again we can not loop over all the inputs seed, so we have to find another way.
What I've come up with is to actually loop backwards from the location map until we end up with the seed for the given location.
For the location number we just start at the absolute minimum which is `0` and repeat this process until we first hit a seed
which is in one of all the input seed ranges.

The first thing we have to do is to reverse the maps list, and also we have to swap every destination range with the source range.

```kotlin
val reversedMaps = maps.map {
    ConversionMap(it.entries.map { old ->
        RangeEntry(old.sourceStart, old.destinationStart, old.length)
    })
}.reversed()
```

I just manually create new objects for all the entries with the values swapped, but you could of course also do this
with an extra function inside our data class.

So now we get to the interesting part, which is the infinite loop from 0 until we find our first hit.
To do this I'm once again going to use the `generateSequence` function from the kotlin standard library.
As the seed I just use `0` and I increment by one on every loop.

I'm just immediately going to show the full function chain since it's not much different from the first part as you will see.

```kotlin
return generateSequence(0, Long::inc).first { location ->
    val seed = reversedMaps.fold(location) { acc, map ->
        map.entries.find { acc in it.sourceRange }?.destinationForSource(acc) ?: acc
    }

    seedRanges.any { seedRange -> seed in seedRange }
}
```

So as you can see I just use the first function with returns the location value of the sequence once it's predicate is
truthy. The predicate in this case is true if the seed is contained in one of our input seed ranges.
For the map traversing part it's actually pretty much the same as in part one.

With all that done our full function for part two looks like this:

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Long {
    val (seeds, maps) = parseInput(input)
    val seedRanges = seeds
        .windowed(2, 2)
        .map { it[0] .. it[0] + it[1] }

    val reversedMaps = maps.map {
        ConversionMap(it.entries.map { old ->
            RangeEntry(old.sourceStart, old.destinationStart, old.length)
        })
    }.reversed()

    return generateSequence(0, Long::inc).first { location ->
        val seed = reversedMaps.fold(location) { acc, map ->
            map.entries.find { acc in it.sourceRange }?.destinationForSource(acc) ?: acc
        }

        seedRanges.any { seedRange -> seed in seedRange }
    }
}
```

As you can see it actually looks pretty simple. But let's see how it performs.
Let's start by trying to run our test examples which actually is super easy because there are not a lot of
input seeds, and you could just solve this the same way as the first part, but this of course does not work
with our personal input which is a million times larger. So the test immediately passes and returns the expected
`46` for the lowest location.

Let's try running it with the actual input. After about `30` seconds of pure run time, it returns the number `72263011`.
So our outer sequence function incremented `72263011` times which is a lot, but since sequences are insanely optimized in kotlin
it actually _only_ took about `30` seconds. And yes the output is correct as well.

Both stars ⭐⭐ collected for today!

## Final Words

I remember writing yesterday that the challenge was a bit too easy, and then well today I got hit with this one.
This was a massive spike in difficulty compared to the last days, and I don't think that it will stay like this but let's see tomorrow.

I hope your as excited as I am, see you tomorrow!
