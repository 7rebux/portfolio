Today is the third day of the 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge and that means another puzzle is waiting to be solved.
So day 3 is usually where the problems become a little bit more complicated.
And this seems to be the case today, because the first thing that comes to our eyes is a grid with symbols and numbers, but more on that later.

First of all let me explain what happened story wise for today.
As we were walking up that mountain yesterday we now reached a gondola lift station.
The lift can take us up to the water source, but there is of course a problem.
The gondolas are not moving. And next to them, we find an engineer elf with a wrench.
So we offer our help, and he proceeds to explain the problem to us.

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

The elf explains that an engine part seems to be missing, but he can not figure out which one.
He also says if we can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.

And this engine schematic is actually our today's puzzle input.
Let's take a look at the example input.

```text
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```

So as we can see we got lots of symbols and numbers.
Points `.` do not count as a symbol by the way.
We don't really understand what the meaning of each individual symbol is.
The only thing we know is that **any number adjacent to a symbol** is considered a `part number`.
Not only vertically or horizontally connected but also diagonally.
So we are always looking at a `3x3` sub grid to scan for those `part numbers`.

If we take a look at the first symbol in the example which is `*` in line `2` at column `4`, the adjacent numbers to this symbol are `467` and `35`.
Not `114` because this number does not even partially occur in our `3x3` grid.

And yes you heard right, *partially*. We are not only looking at the adjacent digits, instead we are supposed to scan for the full number.
That makes things a lot more complicated, so let's try to solve the first part.

## ‚≠ê Part 1

As the elf mentioned we are supposed to **add up all the part numbers**, so that will be our result for this part.
Because today input parsing is not really required we can start directly by finding all of the `part numbers`.

For that to be possible we first have to find every valid symbol inside our input data.

Let's start by writing a simple extension function to validate if a given `Char` is a valid symbol in this case.
An extension function is a special feature in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) which allows us to extend objects with our own defined functions on them.
You can read more about this principle [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html).

```kotlin
private fun Char.isSymbol(): Boolean {
    return !(this == '.' || this.isDigit())
}
```

In extension function the keyword `this` is just the reference to the object.
We just check that the character is **not** a `.` and not a digit.

With that done we can move on to looping over every character in our given input.
Let's just do that with a simple nested for loop first:

```kotlin
for ((y, line) in input.withIndex()) {
    for ((x, c) in line.withIndex()) {
        if (!c.isSymbol()) {
            continue
        }

        // TODO: Find all part numbers
    }
}
```

This is just the normal way of performing a `forEachIndexed`.
Oh, and by the way `withIndex` just combines each value with it's corresponding index.
I will get back to simplifying this in a more functional approach later don't worry!

What we have to do first is to find all `adjacent` numbers of the current symbol.
So let's quickly create a function for that:

```kotlin
private fun findAdjacentNumbers(input: List<String>, point: Point): List<Int> {...}
```

As the parameters I'm passing in the input list and the indices of the symbol as a `Point`.
This is just a data class looking like this:

```kotlin
private data class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int)
```

Now let's think about how to find all `adjacent` numbers in here.
As I already mentioned early we have to find the `3x3` grid with the `symbol` in the center.
So there are multiple ways to achieve this, but what I did is to create a `List` of all directions `-1, 0, 1` and added them
to each axis to get the delta values of each index. Then I just filter out the point of the symbol in the center and return all the 8 surrounding points.

```kotlin
private fun Point.getNeighbors(): List<Point> {
    val directions = listOf(-1, 0, 1)

    return directions
        .flatMap { dX -> directions.map { dY -> Point(x + dX, y + dY) } }
        .filter { it != this }
}
```

With this function done we can now loop over all neighbors in our `findAdjacentNumbers` function and watch out
for all numbers we can find there. While we are at it let's also make sure that each neighbor is still in bounds of our input,
so we don't have to fight around with `IndexOutOfBounds` exceptions later.

```kotlin
point.getNeighbors().filter { p ->
    p.y in input.indices &&
    p.x in input[p.y].indices &&
    input[p.y][p.x].isDigit()
}
```

This is a super convenient way of doing this in kotlin as you can see. I'm just checking if the given index is present in
its corresponding indices iterator. And as you can see I'm also checking if the character at our current point is a digit,
because otherwise there would be no need to scan for the full number.

Let's continue by actually finding the whole `Integer` and not only just the digits at our neighbors positions.
To do that I'm going to create another function which will return the `Integer` and just takes the position of a single digit as it's input.

```kotlin
private fun String.findNumberAt(point: Point): Int {...}
```

As you can see this is an extension function on the `String` object.
This is because we only have to scan for full numbers in the same `line` since they are being read from left to right.

But now let's actually think about how we can approach this. We only know where one single digit is, and we also do not know
if this is the first digit or the last digit or any digit in between of our searched number.
My thought immediately was to scan all the characters to the left until we find our starting index and then do the same in the opposite direction (right)
to find the ending index. With knowing both of these indices we can then build together the full number.

But how are we going to implement this now? Well again there are many ways to do this, and I will show the normal way and then the more or less functional
equivalent of doing this.

Let's start of with the traditional way:

```kotlin
private fun String.findNumberAt(point: Point): Int {
    var numberString = ""
    var currentIndex = point.x

    // Determine starting index
    while (currentIndex > 0 && this[currentIndex - 1].isDigit()) {
        currentIndex--
    }

    // Build number string
    while (currentIndex < this.length && this[currentIndex].isDigit()) {
        numberString += this[currentIndex]
        currentIndex++
    }

    return numberString.toInt()
}
```

As you can see I'm just using `while` loops to determine the starting and ending indices.
And again we have to check if we are still in bounds. We could also do this like in the function above but since we do not need a
check in both directions at one time this is also fine. The building process is done with a string which I just add every digit and then
convert it to an `Integer` in the end.

Now let's get to the interesting implementation:

```kotlin
private fun String.findNumberAt(point: Point): Int {
    val firstIndex = generateSequence(point.x, Int::dec)
        .takeWhile { it >= 0 && this[it].isDigit() }
        .last()
    val lastIndex = generateSequence(point.x, Int::inc)
        .takeWhile { it < this.length && this[it].isDigit() }
        .last()

    return (firstIndex..lastIndex)
        .map(this::get)
        .joinToString("")
        .toInt()
}
```

So in this approach I'm not using a `while` loop, instead I'm using the `generateSequence` function from the standard library.
This function takes two parameters. The first one is the `seed` of the sequence and the second one is a function which returns the next value of
the sequence. The second function call here is a `takeWhile`, which just takes every element until the given condition is `false`.
To finish this chain I'm just taking the `last` value of the stream since this is either the one all to the left or all to the right.
After finding the both outer indices I'm just creating a range in between them and map every index to its corresponding character in the string.
And then I'm just combining them all into a `String` and converting it to the final `Integer`.

Now we just need to call this function inside our `findAdjacentNumbers` numbers function on each point:

```kotlin
private fun findAdjacentNumbers(input: List<String>, point: Point): List<Int> {
    return point.getNeighbors()
        .filter { p ->
            p.y in input.indices &&
            p.x in input[p.y].indices &&
            input[p.y][p.x].isDigit()
        }
        .map { p -> input[p.y].findNumberAt(p) }
}
```

And now this function is done right? Well almost there is an important thing that we missed.
Let me explain. Let's have a look at the first `3x3` grid of the example:

```text
7 . .
. * .
3 5 .
```

When looking at the `7` in the top left everything should work as expected. But once we look at the `35` in the bottom row and think
about our implementation we eventually come to the conclusion that the `35` is going to be added **two** times, but there is only one `35`.
That is because we don't actually keep track of our already scanned indices, so let's quickly do that.

For this I'm just going to create a `Set<Point>` in the most top level function. This will not only skip double numbers for the same symbol,
but also all double numbers in general since there might be a case in which 2 symbols *touch* the same number.
Then I'm also going to pass the reference to this list down until the `findNumberAt` function.
And this is the place where we add all of our already `checked` points:

```kotlin
val indices = firstIndex..lastIndex

checked.addAll(indices.map { Point(it, point.y) })
```

Let's also check if a number has already been checked inside the `findAdjacentNumbers` function.
For that I'm just going to replace the `map` function with this thing:

```kotlin
.mapNotNull { p ->
    if (checked.contains(p)) null else input[p.y].findNumberAt(p, checked)
}
```

Now only numbers that we don't already know are being added to the `List`.

With that done we can now **finally** finish of the first part by implementing the `partOne` function:

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Int {
    val checked = mutableSetOf<Point>()

    return input.mapIndexed { y, line ->
        line
            .withIndex()
            .filter { it.value.isSymbol() }
            .map { findAdjacentNumbers(input, Point(it.index, y), checked) }
            .sumOf(List<Int>::sum)
    }.sum()
}
```

As you can see I replaced the `for` loops with an indexed mapping function.
Then I'm just linking the index for each character to itself.
After that I filter everything out, which is not a valid symbol.
And then to finish it of I'm mapping each symbol to it's corresponding adjacent numbers and sum **everything** up.

Let's test this quickly with the example input and see if we are right:

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Int> = mapOf(
    listOf(
        "467..114..",
        "...*......",
        "..35..633.",
        "......#...",
        "617*......",
        ".....+.58.",
        "..592.....",
        "......755.",
        "...$.*....",
        ".664.598..",
    ) to 4361
)
```

The test passed! And also the result of my personal input is correct.
There finally is our first star ‚≠ê of today's challenge.

## ‚≠ê Part 2

So there we are at the final part of today's puzzle.
And don't worry this is not going to take a lot of time.
Actually I only took about 2-3 minutes to solve this part after I was done with the first one.

So let me explain what's going on here.
After we found the first part, the engineer found the missing part and installs it in the engine.
The engine of the gondola springs to life, but it does not seem to move at all.
We actually forgot something. One of the gears in the engine is also broken.
And now we are supposed to find the `gear ratio` in order to fix it.

So let me explain real quick what the `gear ratio` is.

A `gear` is every symbol which represents a `*` in our input.
And the `ratio` is the product of all the adjacent numbers (Which is limited to `2` in the case of a `gear`).

For this part we are supposed to find the sum of all `gear ratios` in our engine schematic.

So what do we have to change for that? Well not that much actually, only the part where we check if the current character is a valid symbol
and the part where we sum all the adjacent numbers up.

Since this is almost the same as part one, I'm actually going to outsource the functionality of part one into another function, so we can call
this one in both parts:

```kotlin
private fun combined(
    input: List<String>,
    isSymbolValid: (Char) -> Boolean,
    formula: (List<Int>) -> Int): Int
{
    val checked = mutableSetOf<Point>()

    return input.mapIndexed { y, line ->
        line
            .withIndex()
            .filter { isSymbolValid(it.value) }
            .map { findAdjacentNumbers(input, Point(it.index, y), checked) }
            .sumOf { formula(it) }
    }.sum()
}
```

I created two extra parameters which are used to validate the symbol and to handle the calculation process.
Now when we use this function for part two it looks like this:

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Int {
    return combined(input, { c -> c == '*' }, { nums ->
        if (nums.size == 2) nums.reduce(Int::times) else 0
    })
}
```

So this time for the symbol validation we are just checking if it equals the symbol for a gear which is `*`.
And for the calculation we first check if the size of the adjacent numbers is exactly `2` and then we do the same
reduce trick to multiply all numbers together like in yesterday's challenge.
You could also write `nums[0] * nums[1]` since this are guaranteed two numbers.

With that our solution for the final part is also done, and we can get to run it.
The test output gives us `467835` which is correct and my personal input data gives me `81721933` which is also correct!
This was the last star ‚≠ê for today!

## Final Words

First of all I would like to mention that there was a lot of changing up functions going on.
So you might be interested in looking at the final result which can be found [here](https://github.com/7rebux/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/de/nosswald/aoc/days/Day03.kt).

I'm writing this blog post in the evening, and over the course of the day I've read some interesting things on the
[Advent of Code subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/). So someone made the assumption that a gear never actually has more than 2 adjacent neighbors.
I tried this for my input and this is actually not true. So be careful with your solution when you rely on that.
And also a number is never adjacent to more than one symbol, which is actually true in my case.
But I still took care of this edge case in my solution to provide an accurate solution.

As always thanks for reading today's post which was actually pretty long.
And hopefully we see each other on tomorrow's puzzle! :)
