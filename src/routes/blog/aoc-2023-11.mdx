It's 6 am for me on the 11th of December and that means another [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) was just released.
Let's get straight into solving!

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11)

In today's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge we are provided with an image from space:

```text
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....
```

Of course this image is represented in a text format, so we can work with it. In this case the "image" above is the
example input. Every line has the same amount of characters, so we end up with a fixed width and height.
Also, there are only 2 characters:
- `#` For a galaxy
- `#` For empty space

Our objective for today is to find the sum of all distances between all galaxies.
But there's also a little catch to that: Since it takes a lot of time to travel from one galaxy to another,
the space actually expands in this time. For that we are also provided with a rule.
Every row or column which only contains empty space (no galaxy) has to be doubled.

That's all we know so far for part one, let's get coding!

## ⭐ Part 1

To start of implementing this I'm going to create 2 constant values for galaxies and expanded space:

```kotlin
private const val GALAXY = '#'
private const val EXPANDED = 'x'
```

Now I'm not going to parse the input, but actually transform it instead.
My idea is to replace every space which would end up expanded with our defined character for that (`x`).

```kotlin
private fun List<String>.expand(): List<String> {
    return this.map { line ->
        if (line.none { it == GALAXY })
            EXPANDED.toString().repeat(line.length)
        else {
            line
                .mapIndexed { i, old -> if (this.none { it[i] == GALAXY }) EXPANDED else old }
                .joinToString("")
        }
    }
}
```

To achieve this there are 2 possible cases for each line. The first one being that no single character in the current line is
a galaxy. And the second one that the current index of this line also does not contain a galaxy in every other line at the same index.
If any of this is true I'm replacing the empty space character with a `x`, so we know which space is expanded later on.

After running this, the example input now looks like this:

```text
..x#.x..x.
..x..x.#x.
#.x..x..x.
xxxxxxxxxx
..x..x#.x.
.#x..x..x.
..x..x..x#
xxxxxxxxxx
..x..x.#x.
#.x.#x..x.
```

For the next step I stored every galaxy with its coordinates in a list.
And I also created a data class for that:

```kotlin
private data class Galaxy(val x: Int, val y: Int)

val galaxies = space.flatMapIndexed { y, line ->
    line.mapIndexedNotNull { x, c ->
        if (c == GALAXY) Galaxy(x, y) else null
    }
}
```

Now we can actually implement a function which counts the steps it takes from one galaxy to another.
Since we are not allowed to walk diagonally this will be the [manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between the two points.

To now calculate this while taking into consideration the space expansion, I will sum up all steps it takes to reach the same x and the same y coordinate like so:

```kotlin
private fun countSteps(space: List<String>, a: Galaxy, b: Galaxy): Long {
    val xIndices = if (a.x > b.x) a.x - 1 downTo b.x else a.x until b.x
    val yIndices = if (a.y > b.y) a.y - 1 downTo b.y else a.y until b.y
    val xSteps = xIndices.sumOf { x -> if (space[a.y][x] == EXPANDED) 2 else 1 }
    val ySteps = yIndices.sumOf { y -> if (space[y][a.x] == EXPANDED) 2 else 1 }

    return xSteps + ySteps
}
```

First I create a range of all indices in the path for both axes. And then I count the steps for both by either adding `2` if the current
character is expanded or `1` when it's not.
And in the end we can just return the sum of the x and y-axis steps.

Now all that's left to do is to count the distance between each galaxy in our list and sum them up.
When doing this with a loop we have to make sure that we don't count every path twice (`a to b` and `b to a`).
My solution for that is to drop all the previous galaxies in the inner loop:

```kotlin
return galaxies
    .flatMapIndexed { i, a ->
        galaxies
            .drop(i)
            .map { b -> countSteps(space, a, b) }
    }
    .sum()
```

Now let's see if everything is correct:

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Long> = mapOf(
    listOf(
        "...#......",
        ".......#..",
        "#.........",
        "..........",
        "......#...",
        ".#........",
        ".........#",
        "..........",
        ".......#..",
        "#...#.....",
    ) to 374
)
```

The example input returns `374` and my input gives me `10292708`, and both of these values are correct.
First star ⭐ collected let's get to part two!

## ⭐ Part 2

For part two, all we have to do is to change the expansion size from `2` to `1000000`.

To do this I added a parameter to the `countSteps` function, which retrieves the expansion size:

```kotlin
private fun countSteps(space: List<String>, a: Galaxy, b: Galaxy, expansionSize: Long): Long {
    val xIndices = if (a.x > b.x) a.x - 1 downTo b.x else a.x until b.x
    val yIndices = if (a.y > b.y) a.y - 1 downTo b.y else a.y until b.y
    val xSteps = xIndices.sumOf { x -> if (space[a.y][x] == EXPANDED) expansionSize else 1 }
    val ySteps = yIndices.sumOf { y -> if (space[y][a.x] == EXPANDED) expansionSize else 1 }

    return xSteps + ySteps
}
```

And also I created a combined function for both parts since the rest of the logic stays the exact same.

```kotlin
private fun combined(input: List<String>, expansionSize: Long): Long {
    val space = input.expand()
    val galaxies = space.flatMapIndexed { y, line ->
        line.mapIndexedNotNull { x, c ->
            if (c == GALAXY) Galaxy(x, y) else null
        }
    }

    return galaxies
        .flatMapIndexed { i, a ->
            galaxies
                .drop(i)
                .map { b -> countSteps(space, a, b, expansionSize) }
        }
        .sum()
}
```

With that done my final solution for both parts looks like this:

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Long =
    combined(input, expansionSize = 2)

override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Long =
    combined(input, expansionSize = 1_000_000)
```

When I run this it gives me `82000210` for the test and `790194712336` for myself.
Since this number is that big I used longs in every place and you should too!

Both of these values are correct again, and we grab the second star ⭐ for today!

## Final Words

I actually enjoyed today's challenge a lot since there are many way's on how this could be implemented.
Originally I just duplicated each row and column of the first part which was empty, but well then I saw part two,
and I came up with a much better solution.

And also if you are interested in more approaches to solve this I can really recommend today's
[kotlin livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eBSyPe_9j0). This also explains everything more in depth, and
I really enjoyed watching that this afternoon.

My full code can be found [here](https://github.com/7rebux/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/de/nosswald/aoc/days/Day11.kt).

I hope we see each other tomorrow!
