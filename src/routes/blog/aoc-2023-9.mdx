It's already the 9th day of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). For me everything is still going great
and I hope for you too!

In today's puzzle we are asked to create a report of the environmental instabilities.

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9)

To create this report we got an _Oasis And Sand Instability Sensor_.
Using this sensor we can create a report of our surroundings and this will also be our puzzle input:

```text
0 3 6 9 12 15
1 3 6 10 15 21
10 13 16 21 30 45
```

To find any future instabilities we are supposed to predict the next value for each line.
As you might already have seen each line is a sequence of numbers so our goal is to find the next number in each sequence.

Let's take a look at the first line:

```text
0 3 6 9 12 15
```

Of course, this is a super simple example since every value is just incremented by `3`.
But that also makes it easy to explain the algorithm behind finding the next value.

```text
0   3   6   9  12  15
  3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0
```

The first line is our original input. And every next line contains the differences between each pair of two
values from above. This process has to be repeated until we end up with only differences of `0`.
Now to find the next value in the first line (the original input) we have to sum up all the next values from the previous lines.
To do that we start at the bottom most line and add the last value of that to the last value of the next line.
This would be `0 + 3 = 3`. Then the `3` is inserted as the new last value in the line above.
We repeat this process until we reach the new last value of the first line which is `18` in this case:

```text
0   3   6   9  12  15  18
  3   3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0   0
```

For the output we have to return the sum of all the values we predicted in our input.

## Parsing

Since our input is just numbers split by a whitespace the parsing for today is super easy.

```kotlin
private fun parseInput(input: List<String>): List<List<Int>> {
    return input.map { line -> line.split(" ").map(String::toInt) }
}
```

I just mapped every line to a `List` of integers.

## ⭐ Part 1

Now we have to write up the algorithm I explained above.
Since this process is the same for every line this is a great use case for a recursive function so let's do that.

Like in all recursive functions we first have to define a condition on which we can break.
In this case this happens when we reach the line in which all differences of the previous values are 0.

Let me just show you my function and then explain the rest:

```kotlin
private fun nextInSequence(differences: List<Int>): Int {
    if (differences.sum() == 0) {
        return 0
    }

    val next = differences.zipWithNext().map { it.second - it.first }

    return differences.last() + nextInSequence(next)
}
```

As you can see we just return `0` as the next value if the sum of all current differences is `0`.
Of course, you could also write that like `differences.all { it == 0 }`.

So if we did not reach the last line the next thing to do is to calculate the next line,
I did this by creating pairs of all the numbers in the current line and then mapping it to its difference.
I'm subtracting the first value from the second value since the second value should always be bigger, and we don't
end up with negative numbers.

And now we can just return the current last number plus the last number of the next sequence (which is the recursive function call).

Last thing that's left to do is to apply this function to every line of our input and then sum them all up.

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Int {
    return parseInput(input).sumOf(::nextInSequence)
}
```

I'm not going to explain that since this should be nothing new after the previous days.

Let's write a test for the example input which is provided:

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Int> = mapOf(
    listOf(
        "0 3 6 9 12 15",
        "1 3 6 10 15 21",
        "10 13 16 21 30 45",
    ) to 114
)
```

This test passes, so I can try it with my personal input.
For the output I get `1647269739` and this is correct.

First star ⭐ earned let's move on!

## ⭐ Part 2

For part two we are asked to predict a new first value for each line instead of a new last value.
So well I thought why just not reverse everything?

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Int {
    return parseInput(input).map(List<Int>::reversed).sumOf(::nextInSequence)
}
```

So I just reversed all the parsed input lists and ran the program again.

And the output of `864` actually was correct.
That was easy, both stars ⭐ earned!

## Final Words

I'm kinda confused today, because this is supposed to be a day 9 challenge.
I would even go that far to say that today was actually easier than day 1.
Well at least if you had the idea with the recursion but even without that it was so much easier than yesterday's challenge.
This year's difficulty spikes are super weird, but this also makes me a lot more interested in the upcoming days.

As always you can view my full solution [here](https://github.com/7rebux/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/de/nosswald/aoc/days/Day09.kt).

Let's hope tomorrow is going to be more challenging again!
