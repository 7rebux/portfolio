Welcome back to another day of this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.
I'm super excited for today's puzzle since yesterday we experienced a huge difficulty spike.

It took a lot of time and effort to solve yesterday's challenge (at least for me), but eventually we did it and helped
the gardener and his team to start planting their seeds.
Today we continue our journey to fix the water source. The gardener yesterday told us that there was no sand left to filter
the water and that's why they shut it down.
While travelling across `Island Island` we find a poster with the title `Boat races! ... Desert Island`.
`Desert` island? There has to be sand right - So we manage to sign up as a competitor.
And that's exactly what we are going to be doing today. we will take place in a `Boat race`.

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6)

It does not take us a lot of time to find out that this is (of course) not a normal race.
Instead, we receive a fixed amount of time in which our boat has to travel as far as possible.

As a part of signing up we received a piece of paper with a table on it (our puzzle input):

```text
Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
```

The first row contains the time we have for each race and the bottom row holds the record distance for each given time.

And actually this is not a race with real boats. Instead, we have toy boats with a button on it.
The button is used to increase the speed of the boat. Every boat has a starting speed of `zero millimeters per millisecond`.
For every millisecond we hold the button down at the start of the race, the speed of the boat increases by `1`.

So for example when we take a look at the first entry with a time of `7` milliseconds and a record distance of `9`
millimeters:

- If we don't hold the button at all the boat won't move since it's starting speed is `0` > **0 millimeters**
- If we hold the button down for `1` millisecond the boat has `6` milliseconds left to move with the speed of `1` > **6 millimeters**
- If we hold the button down for `2` milliseconds the boat has `5` milliseconds left to move with a speed of `2` > **10 millimeters**
- And so forth...

Our task for today is to count every possible holding time for the button which results in a new record.
And we have to do that for every boat in the table and then in the end multiply them together.

## ⭐ Part 1

Since the example input and also the personal input only contains 2 lines we don't have to do much parsing.
I tried to oversimplify that part by a lot and I ended up with this neat looking piece of code:

```kotlin
val (times, records) = input.map { line ->
    line
        .split(":")
        .last()
        .split(" ")
        .filter(String::isNotBlank)
        .map(String::toLong)
}
```

Since the first line are the times and the second line are the ranges I just destructor the first two parts from the result list
(which must have a length of 2 anyway). And for that line I just apply the same parsing logic, so I end up with a list of numbers for both.

The next thing that we have to do is to count all possible records for each time.

Let's first create a small helper function to calculate how many records are possible with a given time and record:

```kotlin
private fun countPossibleRecords(time: Long, record: Long): Int {
    return (1..time).count { (time - it) * it > record }
}
```

As you can see I'm just running a count on a range from `1` (since the boat does not move with `0`) until the maximum time (excluded because the boat has no time left to move otherwise).
And then I'm running a simple calculation which is `(time - hold) * hold`. In here `hold` is equivalent to the speed of the boat and `time - hold` is the time we have left to move.
So the result is straight up going to be the distance we travelled.

Also, something nice to point out here is that all the possible distance values are symmetrical because the formula is just a multiplication.
And since we all know `a * b = b * a`.

With that my final solution looks like the following:

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Int {
    val (times, records) = input.map { line ->
        line
            .split(":")
            .last()
            .split(" ")
            .filter(String::isNotBlank)
            .map(String::toLong)
    }

    return times.zip(records).map { (time, record) -> countPossibleRecords(time, record) }.reduce(Int::times)
}
```

The only thing that's left to explain is the zip function which just creates pairs of all the times paired to it's corresponding record distance.
And in the end we just return the product of all the possible record values.

Looks easy, doesn't it? Well let's see if it's also correct.

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Int> = mapOf(
    listOf(
        "Time:      7  15   30",
        "Distance:  9  40  200",
    ) to 288
)
```

The test passes and also my output is valid.
First star ⭐ done let's get to the next part.

## ⭐ Part 2

For part 2 the only thing that really changes is how the input is interpreted.
We have a single race now and not multiple ones. That means all the numbers are just a long number.

Actually to solve this part the only thing that we have to do is to adjust the parsing, which I have done and then my solution
for this part looks like that:

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Int {
    val (time, record) = input.map { line ->
        line
            .split(":")
            .last()
            .filterNot(Char::isWhitespace)
            .toLong()
    }

    return countPossibleRecords(time, record)
}
```

Test instantly passes and also my solution is correct again.
This part actually only took my a few seconds.

But I take that free star ⭐ gift :p

## Final Words

Well, this year is quite confusing when we think of the difficulty differences of each day so far.
Yesterday we had a super hard challenge, and today we get an in my opinion even easier one that `Day 1` this year.
I'm super excited for the next few days to see how this evolves.

Even tho there is nothing you haven't seen in this blog post you can read my full solution [here](https://github.com/7rebux/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/de/nosswald/aoc/days/Day06.kt).

See you tomorrow!
