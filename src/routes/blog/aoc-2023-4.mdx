Welcome back to another [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.
Today is the 4th of December, and I'm super excited about today's puzzle.
I hope so are you!

Yesterday we continued our journey via a gondola which we had to fix.
But we were not actually climbing up a mountain - above us suddenly an entire new landmass
appears. We actually traveled to an island in the sky.

As we exit the gondola we find an elf sitting on the floor and ask him about the water sources.
He tells us that he does not know where it is located but the **gardener** would know.
But to get to the **gardener** we would need a boat, and luckily he would let us borrow his one,
if we help him with a thing.

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

The elf tells us about his **scratchcards** which he got as a gift.
But he can not figure out what he has won.

So our puzzle input for today's challenge are his scratchcards.
Let's take a look at them (the example input):

```text
Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
```

Each card has two lists of numbers (divided by a pipe `|`) written on it.
On the left side are all numbers which would lead to a win.
And on the other side are all the numbers we scratched open.

The value calculation of a card works like this: Every number that we have (on the right side) which is part of
the winning numbers (on the left) counts as one _match_. The first _match_ counts as `1` point and every other _match_ after that
doubles our current points.

This can be written as a simple maths formula:

```text
points = 2^(matches - 1)
```

You might wonder what happens when `matches = 0`. Actually points is also going to be `0` then because
we are working with `Integers`, so the `2^(-1) = 0.5` just becomes `0` after converting it to an `Integer`.

What we are looking for today is the sum of all point values on each card.

## Parsing

Let's start by once again parsing our input.
I created a `Card` data class for this, which has the following signature:

```kotlin
data class Card(val id: Int, val winning: List<Int>, val actual: List<Int>)
```

Then I created a function to map each line of our input to a `Card` object:

```kotlin
private fun parseInput(input: List<String>): List<Card> {
    return input.mapIndexed { index, line ->
        val (winning, actual) = line
            .substringAfter(':')
            .split("|")
            .map { numbers ->
                numbers
                    .split(" ")
                    .filter(String::isNotBlank)
                    .map(String::toInt)
            }

        return@mapIndexed Card(index + 1, winning, actual)
    }
}
```

This actually looks more complicated than it actually is, let me explain.
So in the first place I'm once again using the `mapIndexed` function just like in the second day since
the id is just incremented by `1` every line.

Then I remove everything in front of the `:` and split on the `|` to get the `winning` (left) and the `actual` (right) side of the numbers.
But since this two sides are still respresentd as a `String` we also have to map them to a `List` of `Int`.
I'm doing this by splitting on whitespace and then filtering out every blank `String` because there are cases in which `2` or more whitespaces are in between numbers.
Lastly I'm converting every number to an `Integer`.

In the end I'm just passing both number lists and also the index offset by `1` (Because the `Card` id is not zero based) to the `Card` constructor.

## ⭐ Part 1

After parsing all of this, the only thing which is left to do, is to calculate the points of each card and then sum them up.
And this is how I did it:

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Int {
    return parseInput(input).sumOf { card ->
        2.toDouble().pow(card.actual.count(card.winning::contains) - 1).toInt()
    }
}
```

I'm not going to explain the `sumOf` function and things like that. Please read the previous days blog posts if you don't know about this stuff yet.
The only thing which I don't like about this solution is that the `pow` function does not work with `Integers`.
That's because we first have to convert the `base` which is 2 to a `Double` and also convert the result back to an `Integer`.

But this is actually all for the first part, let's get to testing:

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Int> = mapOf(
    listOf(
        "Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53",
        "Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19",
        "Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1",
        "Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83",
        "Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36",
        "Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11",
    ) to 13
)
```

The test passes (`13`) and also the output for my personal puzzle input (`21485`) is correct.
First star ⭐ collected, let's move on!

## ⭐ Part 2

We are just about to report our result to the Elf, but then one of us suddenly notices that the rules
have been actually written to the backside of the cards.

There's no such thing as _points_. Instead, **scratchcards** only cause us to win **more scratchcards** equal to the number of `winning` numbers we have.
Let me explain this process real quick by looking at the first few lines of our example input:

```text
Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
```

When we take a look at the first card, we find four matching numbers (`48`, `17`, `86` and `83`).
This means we win one copy each of the next four cards (ids `2`, `3`, `4` and `5`).
Moving on to the second card. We have two matching numbers (`61` and `32`), so we win one copy each of cards `3` and `4`.
But since we own card `2` exactly two times we get another copy of cards `3` and `4`.
And so on.

When I first solved the part this morning, I created a list and added new `Card` instances every time we would get copies.
But this was a super inefficient solution (took about **6.5 seconds** to run), so I thought about it more deeply.
So first the obvious part, since all the cards we get are just copies of already existing ones, we only have to store how many
copies of each card we have.

I'm doing this by creating a `Map` which associates every card `id` to `1`, since we have `1` instance of each card in the beginning.

```kotlin
val cards = parseInput(input)
val copies = cards
    .associate { it.id to 1 }
    .toMutableMap()
```

And also make sure that the `Map` is `mutable` because we have to increment these values in the next step.

Now we again loop over every card like in the first part and find the number of `winning` (`matching` in this snippet) ones:

```kotlin
cards.forEach { card ->
    val matching = card.actual.count(card.winning::contains)
}
```

Next we have to determine all the card ids which we have to copy. I'm doing this by creating an `Range`
starting at the `id` of the current `Card` offset by `1` to the amount of matching numbers plus the `id` of the current `Card`
offset again by `1`.

```kotlin
val cardsToCopy = (card.id + 1)..(card.id + matching)
```

The parentheses are actually not needed here, but I still include them for better readability.

Now we get to the interesting part. At first, you might think that we need 2 more nested loops for the copying process.
But it's actually only **one**, let me show you:

```kotlin
cardsToCopy.forEach { id ->
    copies[id] = copies[id]!! + copies[card.id]!!
}
```

As you can see I'm not reevaluating all the matching numbers of the copied cards, instead I'm just
adding the amount of copies of our current card to the other ones, which is kind of a _recursive approach_.

So with all of that done the only thing that's left is to count how many `Cards` we have in total, since that is what
is asked for part two.

My final solution is the following:

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Int {
    val cards = parseInput(input)
    val copies = cards
        .associate { it.id to 1 }
        .toMutableMap()

    cards.forEach { card ->
        val matching = card.actual.count(card.winning::contains)
        val cardsToCopy = (card.id + 1)..(card.id + matching)

        cardsToCopy.forEach { id ->
            copies[id] = copies[id]!! + copies[card.id]!!
        }
    }

    return copies.values.sum()
}
```

Let's also test this to see if it works, and indeed it does.
The test returns `30` and my input gives us `11024379` and this is both correct.

Second star ⭐ acquired!

## Final Words

In my opinion today was again a lot easier than yesterday's challenge, but despite that it was a fun puzzle today.
And I'm pretty sure the difficulty is going to raise up really fast in the next few day's.

As always you can find my full solution [here](https://github.com/7rebux/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/de/nosswald/aoc/days/Day04.kt).

See you tomorrow!
