Welcome to today's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. Like on every other day I'm first going to explain
the problem and then how I solved it.

Today we get dropped out of the airship and find ourselves at the edge of a vast desert.
There is also an elf nearby who immediately asks us if we brought *the parts*.
We have no idea what parts she is talking about, and so she tells us to come with her.

She is riding a camel and because this journey is going to take a few days she asks us to play a game of *camel cards*.

## The Problem

> Today's challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)

**Camel cards** is very similar to poker, but a bit simplified. I'm already familiar with the rules of poker so this should
help me a bit.

Let's first take a look at the rules of the game and then afterward at the puzzle input.

Every hand is exactly one type. From strongest to weakest, they are:

- Five of a kind, where all five cards have the same label: `AAAAA`
- Four of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: `AA8AA`
- Full house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different label: `23332`
- Three of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: `TTT98`
- Two pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second label, and the remaining card has a third label: `23432`
- One pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label from the pair and each other: `A23A4`
- High card, where all cards' labels are distinct: `23456`

Hands are primarily ordered based on type; for example, every `full house` is stronger than any `three of a kind`.

In total a hand has `5` cards, which each is any of **A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2**.
To compare two hands we first have to compare the type of the hand, and if the type for both hands is the same we are supposed
to compare each card one by one until we find a difference.

Let's take a look at the example input:

```text
32T3K 765
T55J5 684
KK677 28
KTJJT 220
QQQJA 483
```

Each line contains a hand on the left side and a bit amount on the right side.
I will explain the win amount calculation part later.

## Parsing

The first thing I'm going to do is to create a data class to store the hands:

```kotlin
private data class Hand(val cards: String, val bidAmount: Int)
```

Now let's write a function which maps the lines of our input to `Hand` objects:

```kotlin
private fun parseInput(input: List<String>): List<Hand> {
    return input.map { line ->
        val (cards, bidAmount) = line.split(" ")
        val betterCards = cards
            .replace('A', Char('9'.code + 5))
            .replace('K', Char('9'.code + 4))
            .replace('Q', Char('9'.code + 3))
            .replace('J', Char('9'.code + 2))
            .replace('T', Char('9'.code + 1))

        return@map Hand(betterCards, bidAmount.toInt())
    }
}
```

What I'm doing here is to replace the characters from the cards with other characters which are in a specific order, so we can compare the hands easier later on.
As you can see I take the ASCII code of `9` and add an offset to it and then transforming it back to a `Char` object.

## ⭐ Part 1

With the parsing logic done we can now start implementing part one.
Let's start with the comparison logic of two hand objects.

For that I'm going to extend our `Hand` data class by `Comparable<Hand>` so we can override the `compareTo` function, which
is used by kotlin internally.

```kotlin
override fun compareTo(other: Hand): Int {
    return compareBy(
        { it.groups[0].second },
        { it.groups.getOrNull(1)?.second },
        Hand::cards
    ).compare(this, other)
}
```

Let me also quickly show what `groups` is in this case, before I'm going to explain this thing:

```kotlin
val groups = cards
    .groupBy { it }
    .map { it.key to it.value.size }
    .sortedByDescending { it.second }
    .toMutableList()
```

I'm using groups to create the card type comparison. A group is the amount of each card we have in the current hand.
So for example for the hand `A5352` this would be `[('5', 2), ('A', 1), ('3', 1), ('2', 1)]`.
And this is obviously sorted by the amount of cards. So in this case this would be a `two of a kind`.

The comparison function takes a custom amount of arguments which is compared one after another until a difference is found.
So in our case we first compare the groups and then the hand itself. For the groups we only need the first two because the other ones
are redundant to determine the card type. And the second group can of course also be null in case of a `five of a kind`.

With that done we can now implement a function which calculates the winning amounts:

```kotlin
private fun calculateWinnings(hands: List<Hand>): Int {
    return hands
        .sorted()
        .mapIndexed { i, (_, bidAmount) -> (i + 1) * bidAmount }
        .sum()
}
```

For that we can just sort the hands (which uses our overwritten comparison function) and then take the sum of each hands bit amount multiplied by the index
in the sorted list.

This is all we had to do for part one, and so we end up with this function:

```kotlin
override fun partOne(input: List<String>): Int =
    calculateWinnings(parseInput(input))
```

Let's also just implement the test case which is expected to output `6440`:

```kotlin
override val partOneTestExamples: Map<List<String>, Int> = mapOf(
    listOf(
        "32T3K 765",
        "T55J5 684",
        "KK677 28",
        "KTJJT 220",
        "QQQJA 483",
    ) to 6440
)
```

When running this the test passes and my output is `250898830` which is correct!
First star ⭐ collected, let's move on!

## ⭐ Part 2

For part two the `J` card now becomes a `joker card`. Whenever this card is in a hand it's used to improve the type of the hand.
So for example a `three of a kind` becomes a `four of a kind`. But also when encountering a joker card while comparing the cards of the hand
it should be treated as the lowest cards of all.

To do that let's first create a new value for our joker card, which ASCII code is less than the current lowest card `2`.
So let's just use `1` for that:

```kotlin
private const val JOKER_PART_TWO = '1'
```

Next I created a `partTwo: boolean` parameter in the parsing function, which then decides with which character `J` should be replaced:

```kotlin
{...}
.replace('J', if (partTwo) JOKER_PART_TWO else Char('9'.code + 2))
```

Now we just need to adjust the type comparison, and then we should be done.

For that I created a new function in the `Hand` class:

```kotlin
fun handleJokerCards() {
    cards.count { it == JOKER_PART_TWO }.let { jokerCards ->
        if (jokerCards in 1..4) {
            groups.removeIf { it.first == JOKER_PART_TWO }
            groups[0] = groups[0].first to groups[0].second + jokerCards
        }
    }
}
```

This function starts by counting how many joker cards are in the current hand.
If we at least have `1` joker card and at max `4`, I'm removing the group which corresponds to the joker cards, and
I'm adding the amount of it to the group with the most cards which is always at index `0`.
The rest of the logic can actually stay the same.

With that done my `partTwo` function looks like this:

```kotlin
override fun partTwo(input: List<String>): Int {
    return parseInput(input, partTwo = true)
        .onEach(Hand::handleJokerCards)
        .run(::calculateWinnings)
}
```

Let's run it and see what we get. For the test the output is `5905` and for my input it is `252127335`.
Both numbers are correct, and so we collect the second star ⭐ for today.

## Final Words

Today was actually a quite cool challenge because there are many different ways in which this could be solved. Not only for part two but
for both parts. And there we're a lot of smart approaches to this, which I think I used a few super cool ones.
But I can also recommend looking at the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18cnzbm/2023_day_7_solutions/) of today's challenges to see how others solved it!
